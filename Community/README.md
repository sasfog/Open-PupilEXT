## PupilEXT Experimental Community Version
---
PupilEXT Experimental Community Version is maintained by Gábor Bényei (kheki4) and Attila Boncsér (sasfog).

The branch has been added to the PupilEXT project GitHub, to add several new features to the program.

We kindly ask anyone, who would also like to contribute to the PupilEXT development in near future, to first contact Gábor or Attila, as active development is carried out on this branch. This is important, because their joint effort is motivated by a university project, which needs them to carefully document any improvement made to the program.

New features have already been developed, but they are under testing. We will upload the code in the coming month.

Planned features are going to be published under the issues page, while a public discussion will be maintained to keep track of the development and discuss any new feature suggestions.

Note that this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty, without even the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose
